# ASSESSMENT 4: Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.  

1. What are props in React?

  Your answer: Props stands for properties in react. It is used to pass elements from one component to another. An example is that the properties from the parent component  are passed to its child compenent and then accessed in the child element using this.props.

  Researched answer: Props in react is a keyword that stands for properties. It is used for passing data from one component to another. Data in props is passed in a single direction.



2. What is a DOM event?

  Your answer: DOM events allow you to use different event handlers on your HTML elements. These are used in conjunction with functions to handle an action such as a click of a button resulting in an event being triggered.

  Researched answer:DOM events are signals that some change has occured. This can be triggered by the user or by the browser. Examples of these events are onclick, onmousedown, ondrag, onload etc...



3. What is object-oriented programming? How is it different than functional programming?

  Your answer: A programming technique that is based on objects and classes. It is designed to create reusable peices of code that can create, update or modify new objects. The difference between the two is how data is stored and manipulated. In OOP data is stored in objects and can be created as instances of a class. Functional on the otherhand can not be stored in an object and must be manipulated through the creation of functions.

  Researched answer: Object oriented programming is based on objects and classes. Classes are the blueprint that object instances will use to form in a program. The class properties will be passed to each instance where the object can modify or update its own properties. Wheras Functional programming relies on functions to manipulate data. The function uses commands and data to return desired data.



4. What is the difference between a Float and an Integer in Ruby?

  Your answer: In Ruby unlike JS, a Float and Integer are different datatypes. The difference is a float is a number with a decimal point and a number without a decimal point. You must use Float data types if you wish to receive any type of decimal result in your calculation.

  Researched answer: In Ruby a Float data type is a number that contains a decimal point. An Integer data type is considered any number that does not have a decimal.



5. Ruby has an implicit return. What does that mean?

  Your answer: Implicit return is how Ruby returns data from its blocks. Ruby does not require a return statement in its blocks. The last line in the block will automatically return when executed.

  Researched answer: Ruby methods or blocks always return the result of the last line of an expression. This is unless an explicit return comes before it. This is considered implicit return.



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

1. Instance Variable: This is a variable that is declared in a class outside of the constructor, method or block. These are created when an object is initiated.

2. PostgreSQL: Is a relational database. The data points are stored in rows and the columns are different data attributes. A table will store multiple related rows.

3. Ruby on Rails: Is an open source framework for Ruby web development. It provides structure for written code. It simplifies common repetitive tasks.

4. ORM:It is Object-relational mapping. An ORM is a technique that allows you to query information from a database. An ORM is written in your chosen language and contains the code needed to manipulate the data. This allows you to work directly with the ORM insted of the database.

5. Active Record: It is the layer of MVC that represents buisness data and logic. It monitors the development of buisness objects that require constant storage to the database.
